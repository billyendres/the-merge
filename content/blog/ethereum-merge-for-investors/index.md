### Eco-friendly Ethereum

One of the key features of blockchain technology is its decentralised nature and ability to achieve network consensus without a third party intermediary. The two most prominent consensus mechanisms are [proof-of-work](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways,transactions%20and%20mining%20new%20tokens) (PoW), often referred to as mining and [proof-of-stake](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp#:~:text=Proof%2Dof%2DWork%3F,new%20blocks%20to%20the%20blockchain) (PoS), which involves network participants staking their capital to help secure the network.

The merge, previously known as Eth2 is a long awaited upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain that will combine the [Beacon Chain](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/beacon-chain/) with their [Mainnet](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#mainnet). The merge has been in the works for several years and although it has been postponed due to development delays, it is tentatively due to be released by late 2022. This switch from a PoW to a PoS model aims to minimise energy consumption while improving the efficiency of the network.

### An investors perspective

As the second largest cryptocurrency by [marketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), with over [3000 dApps](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/2021/02/08/which-crypto-projects-are-based-on-ethereum/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20crypto%20app,running%20on%20the%20Ethereum%20blockchain.) built on its blockchain, we know that **Ethereum** acts as a key foundational layer for the growth and development of much of the blockchain ecosystem. 

So the question is, how will these changes affect me as an investor? <br/>To help better understand the potential price response to the merge let's start from a macro market, top down approach.

**Supply and demand**

As displayed above, the amount of Ethereum available for purchase on cryptocurrency exchanges has been declining steadily since late 2020, currently at all-time-lows. This decline in supply and continued growth in demand has led to exponential ETH price rises in the past couple of years, with buyers paying close to $5000 per coin in late 2021. 


**Priced in changes**

It's no secret that the Ethereum development team have been working on the proposed merge for years and there has been plenty of speculation from both bulls and bears as to how this might impact price. What is abundantly clear is that a lot of investors are willing to hold their ETH long term, choosing to withdraw their coins from exchanges rather than sell at current market price.

**Analysis**

As is often the case in cryptocurrency investing, the merge and its potential effect on price can be interpreted in different ways. The upgrade could see an increase in demand as developers aim to utilise and build upon the improved blockchain network, while buyers hunt to capitalise on these developments, driving prices further to the upside.

 On the contrary, the upgrades to the Ethereum blockchain may well be priced in to the current market valuation. The merge has been in development for a long period of time; investors and large corporations have had time to consider their positions and may even use this release as exit liquidity as retail buyers flood the market looking for a quick pump in ETH prices.    



### Rewards - staking vs mining

Blockchains generate revenue through transaction fees, in the case of Ethereum these fees are known as [gas](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/). Whether you're buying and selling NFTs, trading on DeFi exchanges or using P2E Games, every transaction on the Ethereum blockchain is paid for via a gas fee which is then divided up and distributed to network participants as a reward for their mining efforts. As we can see in the table below, these fees add up **quickly**. During the recent [Yuga Labs](https://twitter.com/yugalabs) [OthersideMeta](https://twitter.com/OthersideMeta) listing, network participants were paying upward of $2000 per transaction just to use the Ethereum blockchain and mint their NFT land plots, resulting in gas transaction fees of over 80,000 ETH.

As previously mentioned, the current PoW consensus incentivises miners. This is great for those who have the minimum required 32 ETH on hand and are able to afford the expensive hardware and graphics cards to run their operations. However, Ethereum miners can opt to quickly take their ETH rewards and sell at market price, covering costs and locking in a quick profit.

The merge upgrade will throw away this mining model, thus lowering the barrier to entry for ETH holders who will be able to stake their coins and receive rewards for their efforts in helping to secure the network. 

These changes however, do come at a cost. With a lower barrier to entry, more participants are expected to stake their ETH coins resulting in a lower projected APY. There are tools available that will help gauge your potential [staking rewards](https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/ethereum-2-0/) as a [validator](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/#pos-staking-validators), or through [staking pools](https://ethereum.org/en/staking/pools/#main-content) such as [Stake Wise](https://stakewise.io/) or [Lido Finance](https://lido.fi/ethereum), with returns between 4-8% APY.

 For those without the time to worry about staking pools or validator nodes thankfully, there are simpler alternatives. Platforms such as [Celsius](https://celsius.network/) offer up to 6% APY for you to lock up your crypto and let them deal with the tricky stuff!

### Summary

The Merge is one of the most anticipated events in the history of blockchain and decentralised technologies. Whether you're a long-term HODLer or a speculative investor watching from afar, all eyes will be on Ethereum!
