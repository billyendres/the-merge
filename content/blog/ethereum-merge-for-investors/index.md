description: The upcoming Merge on the Ethereum mainnet has got the crypto world talking. So what do these changes involve and how might they affect you? <br/> Let's find out!

As the second largest cryptocurrency by marketcap, [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) acts as a key foundational layer for the growth and development of much of the blockchain ecosystem. 

### Enter Ethereum 2.0

One of the key features of blockchain technology is its decentralised nature and ability to achieve network consensus without a third party intermediary. The two most prominent consensus mechanisms are [proof-of-work](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways,transactions%20and%20mining%20new%20tokens) (PoW), often referred to as mining and [proof-of-stake](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp#:~:text=Proof%2Dof%2DWork%3F,new%20blocks%20to%20the%20blockchain) (PoS), which involves network participants staking their capital to help secure the network.

The merge, otherwise known as ETH2.0 is a long awaited upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain that has been in the works since 2019 and tentatively due to be released by late 2022. This upgrade aims to improve the efiiciency of the network by switching from a PoW to a PoS model. 

> According to Ethereum developers, this switch will make their blockchain "more scalable, more secure, and more sustainable".

### An investors perspective

As the second largest cryptocurrency by [marketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), with over [3000 dApps](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/2021/02/08/which-crypto-projects-are-based-on-ethereum/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20crypto%20app,running%20on%20the%20Ethereum%20blockchain.) built on its blockchain, we know that **Ethereum** acts as a key foundational layer for the growth and development of much of the blockchain ecosystem. 

So the question is, how will these changes affect me as an investor? <br/>To help better understand the potential price response to the merge, let's start from a macro market, top down approach.

**Supply and demand**

As displayed above, the amount of Ethereum available for purchase on cryptocurrency exchanges has been declining steadily since late 2020, currently at all-time-lows. This decline in supply and continued growth in demand has led to exponential ETH price rises in the past couple of years, with buyers paying close to $5000 per coin in late 2021. 


**Priced in changes**

It's no secret that the Ethereum development team have been working on the proposed merge for years and there has been plenty of speculation from both bulls and bears as to how this might impact price. What is abundantly clear is that a lot of investors are willing to hold their ETH long term, choosing to withdraw their coins from exchanges rather than sell at current market price.

**Analysis**

As is often the case in cryptocurrency investing, the merge and its potential effect on price can interpreted in different ways. The release of ETH2.0 could see an increase in demand as developers aim to utilise and build upon the improved blockchain network, while buyers hunt to capitalise on these developments, driving prices further to the upside.

 On the contrary, the upgrades to the Ethereum blockchain may well be priced in to the current market valuation as the merge has been in development for a long period of time. Investors and large corporations have had time to consider their positions and may even use this release as exit liquidity as retail buyers flood the market looking for a quick pump in ETH price upon its release.    



### According a funnily until pre-set or arrogant well cheerful

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.

1.  So baboon this
2.  Mounted militant weasel gregariously admonishingly straightly hey
3.  Dear foresaw hungry and much some overhung
4.  Rash opossum less because less some amid besides yikes jeepers frenetic
    impassive fruitlessly shut

When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view
back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet
Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rhetoric
question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a
copy.

> The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have
> been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin
> would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and
> return to its own, safe country.

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole
and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects
again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using
her. Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
Consonantia, there live the blind texts.

#### Summary

The driving force in any financial market is the battle of bulls vs bears, when is the best time to buy and when to sell.
